THIS ERROR WAS SOLVED BY
Open the folder you create with ng new and open the package.json file. 
In devDependencies change the version of "jasmine-core" 3.6.0 to 3.8.0 
and "karma-jasmine-html-reporter" from 1.7.0 to 1.6.0 and save it. 
Then go back to Terminal and go to your project and run npm install. 
Now it works and you can run ng serve.
